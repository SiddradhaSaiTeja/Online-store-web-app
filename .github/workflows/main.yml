### âš¡ What Changed
- Removed problematic `()` around long text.  
- Replaced them with `:` or arrows `â†’` (which render fine).  
- Kept node labels short and clean.

### ðŸ§ª Test First
Before pasting the full diagram, test with this tiny block to confirm your GitHub renders Mermaid:

```markdown
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Homepage] --> B[Search] --> C[Filtered Results]

If this works âœ…, then paste the longer version.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to **rewrite the full README with this corrected workflow diagram already inserted** so you just copyâ€“paste it once without worrying about formatting errors?
